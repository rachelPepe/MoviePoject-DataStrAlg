# MoviePoject-DataStrAlg

Shortest Path Finder using Dijkstra's Algorithm
This project implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between vertices in a graph. It uses a graph representation and implements the algorithm to calculate the minimum distance from a starting vertex to all other vertices.

Additionally, the project integrates data from a CSV file containing movies to demonstrate the practical use of the graph and algorithm. The ChainingHashTable is used to store movie data for efficient lookups.
